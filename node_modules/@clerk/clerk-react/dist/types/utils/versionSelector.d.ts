/**
 * This version selector is a bit complicated, so here is the flow:
 * 1. Use the clerkJSVersion prop on the provider
 * 2. Use the exact `@clerk/clerk-js` version if it is a `@snapshot` prerelease for `@clerk/clerk-react`
 * 3. Use the prerelease tag of `@clerk/clerk-react`
 * 4. Fallback to the major version of `@clerk/clerk-react`
 * @param clerkJSVersion - The optional clerkJSVersion prop on the provider
 * @returns The npm tag, version or major version to use
